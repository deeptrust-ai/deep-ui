<h1>DeepTrust's UI Library</h1>

Almost all components are built using [Frosted-UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/frosted-ui), a React component library designed for building modern web applications with a focus on accessibility and ease of use.
For the complete catalogue of base components, props, and usage patterns, refer to the official [Frosted-UI documentation](https://storybook.whop.dev/?path=/docs/guides-1-getting-started--docs); DeepUI adopts those primitives directly.

This documentation site focuses on the curated set of DeepUI components that wrap Frosted-UI primitives with DeepTrust-specific styling, defaults, or multi-component compositions for richer experiences. Explore the showcased patterns to see how DeepUI can enhance your application's user interface while staying aligned with Frosted-UI under the hood.

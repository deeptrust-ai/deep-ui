<h1>DeepTrust's UI Library</h1>

Almost all components are built using [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes), a React component library designed for building modern web applications with a focus on accessibility and ease of use.
For the complete catalogue of base components, props, and usage patterns, refer to the official [Radix UI documentation](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/overview/getting-started); DeepUI adopts those primitives directly.

This documentation site focuses on the curated set of DeepUI components that wrap Radix UI primitives with DeepTrust-specific styling, defaults, or multi-component compositions for richer experiences. Explore the showcased patterns to see how DeepUI can enhance your application's user interface while staying aligned with Radix UI under the hood.

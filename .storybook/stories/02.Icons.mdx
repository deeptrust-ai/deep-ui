# Icons

DeepUI leverages the [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/) library for its iconography. Phosphor is a flexible, open-source icon set with a wide variety of styles and weights, making it easy to find icons that fit your design needs.

## Installation

DeepUI expects [@phosphor-icons/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@phosphor-icons/react) to be available in the consuming application. Install it alongside DeepUI:

```bash
npm install @phosphor-icons/react
```

The icons package ships plain React components, so no extra bundler plugins are required.

## Basic Usage

Each icon is exported as a PascalCased component from `@phosphor-icons/react`. Import the icon you need and render it like any other React component.

```tsx
import { AcornIcon } from '@phosphor-icons/react';
import { Button } from '@deeptrust/deep-ui';

export function IconDemo() {
  return (
    <Button>
      <AcornIcon size={16} weight="bold" />
      Harvest
    </Button>
  );
}
```

- `size` accepts a number or string and controls the width/height in pixels (defaults to `24`).
- `weight` toggles stylistic variants (`"thin" | "light" | "regular" | "bold" | "fill" | "duotone"`).
- Additional props such as `color`, `mirrored`, and `className` are also supported; see the [Phosphor docs](https://phosphoricons.com/) for the full API.

## Dynamic Icons

Phosphor exposes a tree-shakeable index, so importing icons individually keeps bundles small. When you need to choose icons at runtime, load them via dynamic imports:

```tsx
const { CameraIcon } = await import('@phosphor-icons/react/dist/ssr/CameraIcon');
```

The `dist/ssr` entry contains pre-renderable components (no browser-only APIs) which makes them safe for SSR frameworks.

## Styling Tips

Icons inherit `currentColor` by default, so they adopt the text color of their container. Adjust button/icon spacing with inline styles or SCSS:

```tsx
<Button style={{ gap: '0.5rem' }}>
  <AcornIcon weight="fill" />
  Plant
</Button>
```

If you need consistent icon sizing across the app, define a utility class in your global stylesheet:

```css
.icon-sm {
  width: 16px;
  height: 16px;
}
```

```tsx
<AcornIcon className="icon-sm" />
```

## Using With DeepUI Slots

Buttons, chips, and other DeepUI components typically accept arbitrary children. When placing icons next to text:

1. Import the icon component directly from `@phosphor-icons/react`.
2. Wrap it in the target component’s children.
3. Optionally add layout helpers (`gap`, `display: inline-flex`) either via provided props or custom classes.

```tsx
<Button variant="soft" color="info">
  <AcornIcon weight="duotone" />
  Info
</Button>
```

That’s all that’s required—no manual SVG configuration. Browse the [Phosphor gallery](https://phosphoricons.com/) to find icons and copy the generated import snippet straight into your DeepUI project.
